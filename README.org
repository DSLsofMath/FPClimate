* FPClimate
PhD course on "Functional Programming and Climate Impact Research"

+ First instance: spring term 2024, end of March - May/June.
+ Second instance: prel. mid March - May/June 2026 (TBD)

*Abstract*: This is a course aimed at PhD students or MSc students
interested in the application of functional programming,
domain-specific languages, and dependent types to climate impact
research.

* Week 13:
** FPClimate seminar 1
+ [[file:ref/FPClimate_seminar_1.pdf][Introduction slides (Patrik Jansson)]] including exercises
+ We did a round of introductions, followed by an introduction by
  Patrik to the course (prerequisites, contents, examination, learning
  outcomes, schedule, first few weeks).
+ Then Patrik presented some introductory material (see the slides)
  about equations, problems, solutions, specifications,
  domain-specific languages, etc.
+ In the course we use logic and functional programming notation
  (mostly Haskell and Agda) to specify, implement, and test concepts
  from Climate Impact Research.
+ Brief introduction to some relevant domain-specific notions:
  prisoner's dilemma, strategy profile, Nash equilibrium, policies,
  optimality, agent-based models, green growth, equational reasoning.
+ Homework for next seminar:
  + solve the exercises and
  + actively read [[file:ref/2010_Vulnerability_Modelling.pdf][Vulnerability modelling with functional programming and dependent types]] in preparation for the seminar by Cezar Ionescu.
+ Next up is an invited talk:
** Talk by [[https://4c.cst.cam.ac.uk/staff/professor-anil-madhavapeddy][Prof. Anil Madhavapeddy]]
+ [[https://intranet.chalmers.se/en/current/calendar/2024/03/26/functional-programming-for-the-planet---28373][Announced separately]] [will be in room HB2]
+ Title: (Functional) Programming for the Planet
+ Abstract: As simultaneous crises in emissions and biodiversity sweep the planet, computer systems that analyse the complex interplay of our globe’s health are ever more crucial to guiding policy decisions about how to get out of the mess we’re in. In this talk, we examine how functional programming can contribute to building systems that are more resilient, predictable and reproducible in the face of huge amounts of input data (such as from satellites and ground sensing) that demands precise access control (or else poachers and malicious actors go straight to the source) and requires interactive exploration from non-CS-experts at different levels of the software stack (to do climate science). We will also highlight how our ongoing cross-disciplinary research is having a real impact on conservation projects that are sorely underserved by current systems/PL infrastructure, and also how we went about forging these links. We hope to encourage some of you to form your own local collaborations with your colleagues working on the climate crisis!

* Week 14:
** TODO solve W13 exercises ([[file:ref/FPClimate_seminar_1.pdf][FPClimate_seminar_1.pdf)]] and W15 preparation exercises ([[file:ref/seminar_2_exercises.pdf][ref/seminar_2_exercises.pdf]])
** TODO read and prepare questions for "[[file:ref/2010_Vulnerability_Modelling.pdf][Vulnerability modelling ...]]" paper
* Week 15:
** FPClimate seminar 2
+ Lecture ([[file:ref/FPClimate_seminar_2.pdf][slides]], [[file:ref/FPClimate_seminar_2.org][source]]) by [[https://www.th-deg.de/en/Cezar-Ionescu-Fakult%C3%A4t%20Angewandte%20Informatik-Professor:innen-1975][Prof. Cezar Ionescu]] about [[file:ref/2010_Vulnerability_Modelling.pdf][Vulnerability Modelling with Functional Programming and Dependent Types]]
  + (Prof. Ionescu very sadly passed away after severe illness in October 2024.)
+ Background: Algebra of Programming (the book, by Richard Bird and Ooge de Moor)
  - Category theory is an extensible language for precisely formulating mathematical theories (concepts, models, etc.).
  - One such extension is particularly well-suited for formulating /functional programs/.
  - Further extensions allow us to formulate /specifications/.
  - There are other frameworks with similar properties: higher-order logics (dependent types), Hoare logics, etc.
  - The categorical framework is good for /equational reasoning/.
+ Potsdam Institute for Climate *Impact* Research (PIK)
  + The work described in this lecture (and this course) started at PIK, around 2010.
  + Relation-based computations in a monadic BSP model [Botta, Ionescu, 2007] [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parco.2007.08.002][doi:10.1016/j.parco.2007.08.002]], [[https://publications.pik-potsdam.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_14222][PIK page]]
+ Vulnerability modelling [the paper this seminar is about]
  + Motivated by a surge in "Vulnerability assessment" work in the climate change community.  
  + Cezar's paper first submitted in 2010, published 2014, Journal version 2016!
  + [[doi:10.1017/S0960129514000139]["Vulnerability Modelling with Functional Programming and Dependent Types"]] [Ionescu, 2016] [[https://doi.org/10.1017/S0960129514000139][doi:10.1017/S0960129514000139]]
+ Definitions
  + There were _many_ attempts at defining "vulnerability" around 2000 [Thywissen 2006 lists 36!]
+ The Structure of Vulnerability (according to [Ionescu, 2016])
   #+begin_src haskell
   possible       ::  Functor f => State -> f Evolution

   harm           ::  Preorder v => Evolution -> v

   measure        ::  Functor f, Preorder v, Preorder w => f v -> w

   vulnerability  ::  Preorder w => State -> w

   vulnerability  =   measure . fmap harm . possible
   #+end_src
  + The paper presents a few examples which fit this structure.
+ Vulnerability measures
  + should be monotonic
  + can be related by natural transformations between representations of possibility
  + should be "compatible"
+ Next stage: dependent types
  + (under the influence of Patrik Jansson)
  + moving the categorical machinery to the new framework
+ Conclusions
  + Main idea: formulate problems as programming correctness problems!
  + This can be useful in contexts where simulation is used to replace experiments (climate science, social science, political theory, etc.).
  + Type theory can formulate both correctness conditions and the programs themselves.
  + Moreover, the correctness proofs are then mechanically checked.
    
** TODO Present and discuss solutions to exercises from the previous seminar
** TODO (after the seminar) solve W15 exercises
* Week 16:
** FPClimate seminar 3: Discussion about the current paper: [[file:ref/2011_TestingVsProving.pdf][Testing versus proving in climate impact research]]
+ Exercises: (informally: "re-implement the paper")
*** Q1 (About definition 1): Consider the case
#+BEGIN_SRC pseudocode
    F = Vec 3 (a vector of length 3);
    V = Rational; and
    x1, x2 : F V
    x1 = [1, 1, 1];
    x2 = [1, 2, 1];
#+END_SRC
  + Q1a: What does Def. 1 say about m x1 in relation to m x2?
  + Q1b: What do you think it should say?
  + Q1c: Can you suggest another Def 1' (which is stronger / stricter
    than Def. 1) and captures this case?
*** Q2: Implement some of the Haskell code in section 3 to get a feeling for what can go wrong.
  + Q2a: Find counterexamples to sumList and to supList being
    vulnerability measures.
  + Q2b: Re-implement with Rational instead of Float. Are they correct
    now?
*** Q3: Implement (part of) the code for section 4
  + (starting from the paper or from the subdirectory
    file:ref/test-vs-proof/).
  + Q3a: To get started with Agda, implement a self-contained version
    of the code up to FunctorList (with minimal imports).
  + Q3b: Make the definition of VulnMeas work (type check) for a
    recent version of Agda and its standard library.
  + Q3c: Implement foldMeas based on a suitable number of postulates
    for the properties you need.

** TODO new exercises for S8 / paper 8
+ implement Backwards induction in different languages (one per person)
  + Prel. plan:
    Agda (Oskar),
    Haskell (Janek),
    Python (Adrian),
    Purescript (Nicolas),
    Rust (Tobias),
    Julia (Jayson)
+ and apply it to 2-3 simple examples [generation problem, random walk, your favourite!]
+ More concretely:
  + compute an optimal policy sequence (for, say, n=3 steps)
  + compute all trajectories (or a sample)
  + sort them by probability
  + show the first few examples
  + say something about the computational cost (complexity)
+ You don't need to prove correctness, or implement the dependent
  types, but you need to have a "generic" (polymorphic / parametric)
  solver so that a user can supply a sequential decision problem (X,
  Y, next, reward, ...) and get a solution (a sequence of optimal
  policies).
+ You can assume that the state and action types are finite, so that
  the solution space also is finite.
+ Make sure to provide some test cases and expected outputs.
