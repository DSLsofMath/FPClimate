PhD course on Functional Programming and Climate Impact Research

Title: Functional Programming and Climate Impact Research

Abstract: This is a course aimed at PhD students or MSc students
interested in the application of functional programming,
domain-specific languages, and dependent types to climate impact
research.

** Lecture / seminar / reading plan
The course is based on material from the following research papers:
+ 2010: [[file:ref/2010_Vulnerability_Modelling.pdf][Vulnerability modelling with functional programming and dependent types]]
+ 2011: [[file:ref/2011_TestingVsProving.pdf][Testing versus proving in climate impact research]]
+ 2012: [[file:ref/2012_DepTy_SciComp_978-3-642-41582-1_9.pdf][Dependently-Typed Programming in Scientific Computing - Examples from Economic Modelling]]
+ 2014: [[file:ref/2014_Jansson-Patrik-Computational-Theory-of-GSS.pdf][Towards a Computational Theory of GSS: a Case for Domain-Specific Languages]]
+ 2017: [[file:ref/2017a_SeqDecProb1.pdf][Sequential decision problems, dependent types and generic solutions]]
+ 2017: [[file:ref/2017b_contributions-to-a-computational-theory-of-policy-advice-and-avoidability.pdf][Contributions to a computational theory of policy advice and avoidability]]
+ 2018: [[file:ref/2018_esd-9-525-2018.pdf][The impact of uncertainty on optimal emission policies]]
+ 2023: [[file:ref/2023_MatterMost_s10666-022-09867-w.pdf][Responsibility Under Uncertainty: Which Climate Decisions Matter Most?]]

Good background reading is provided by the 2023 book [[https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/computing-the-climate/64DAAC995DC84241F8D8605B3779C68A]["Computing the Climate"]] by Steve M. Easterbrook.

** Examination

The course is examined through

+ a sequence of hand-ins (solutions to exercises to be further specified during the course)
+ active participation in most of the weekly seminars

The preliminary plan is to award 7.5 higher education credits ([[https://education.ec.europa.eu/education-levels/higher-education/inclusive-and-connected-higher-education/european-credit-transfer-and-accumulation-system][ECTS]])
upon successful completion of the course.

** Learning outcomes

+ Using functional programming specification / implementation /
  formalisation as a way of understanding new domains
+ Understand a selection of topics in Climate Impact Research
+ Experience in using Haskell and Agda for formalisation

** Scheduling
+ The course will start in March (2024-03-??) and end in May or June.
+ TODO details

** Other resources
+ TODO add links to talks, etc. online
