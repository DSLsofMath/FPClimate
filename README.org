** Abstract
This is a course aimed at PhD students or MSc students interested in the application of functional programming, domain-specific languages, and dependent types to climate impact research.

*Note*. This course is run as a seminar / reading course. Therefore, you must have the motivation and capacity to digest material with limited teacher presence.

** Lecture / seminar / reading plan (2026)
/The detailed schedule for 2026 is not yet settled (it depends on the participants' schedules)./

The course is based on material from the following research papers:

Good background reading is provided by:
+ The 2023 book "[[https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/computing-the-climate/64DAAC995DC84241F8D8605B3779C68A][Computing the Climate]]" by Steve M. Easterbrook
+ The 2022 book "[[https://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/domain-specific-languages-of-mathematics-9781848903883][Domain-Specific Languages of Mathematics]]" by Jansson, Ionescu, Bernardy.

** Examination
The course is examined through:

+ a sequence of graded hand-ins (solutions to exercises to be further specified during the course)
+ active participation in most of the weekly seminars

The plan is to award 7.5 higher education credits ([[https://education.ec.europa.eu/education-levels/higher-education/inclusive-and-connected-higher-education/european-credit-transfer-and-accumulation-system][ECTS]]) upon successful completion of the course.

** Prerequisites
+ BSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering or equivalent.
+ Functional programming (ideally in Haskell, but other languages are also OK)
+ Formal methods (ideally using dependent types, but other methods are also OK)

** Learning outcomes
After completion of the course the student should be able to:
+ Use functional programming specification / implementation / formalisation as a way of understanding new domains
+ Understand a selection of topics in Climate Impact Research
+ Effectively use Haskell and Agda for formalisation

*** Knowledge and understanding
+ Master the terminology, concepts and theories associated with the selected area;
+ Demonstrate deep knowledge and understanding in the area of the course, and insight into current research and development;
+ Demonstrate deep methodological knowledge in the area of the course;

*** Skills and abilities
+ Demonstrate the ability to critically and systematically integrate knowledge and to analyse, assess, and deal with complex issues in the area of the course;

*** Judgement and approach
+ Search for, and extract, necessary information from scientific publications in the selected area of the course, with the purpose of identifying strengths and weakness of solutions, approaches and methodologies.

** Scheduling (2026)
+ The course will start in March 2026 and end in May or June.
+ The schedule will be made available below (Dates TBD):

| Week | Date | Time | Event | Room |
|------+------+------+-------+------|
| TBD | TBD | TBD | FPClimate seminar 1 | EDIT 6128 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

+ Time zone: CET (UTC+1) until end of March, then CEST (UTC+2).
+ For local participants, the room is usually EDIT 6128 (at Chalmers campus Johanneberg).
+ For remote participants, the zoom link is almost https://chalmers.zoom.us/my/CUTpatrikja but without the upper case letters.

** How to register
+ If you do not need formal credits, you can just contact Patrik Jansson.
+ If you want credits for your local MSc degree, contact the examiner for (DAT235/DIT577): [[https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~bove/][Ana Bove]]
+ If you want credits for your local PhD degree, obtain the approval of your supervisor and examiner, then contact Patrik Jansson.
