+ Commments below refer to the pre-print in this direcory.
+ Section 4, page 7: the definition of "harm = v . x" is confusing -
  the x and v were defined "long ago" (on page 4).
+ Section 5, page 9: "measure xs = 10" - there is no "xs" in scope?
  Perhaps ns in intended?
+ Section 5, page 9: "measure (fmap inc xs) = 1" This is worth some
  more explanation: the key is that "inc" collapses two inputs to one,
  and thus the joint probability ends up at 0.6 > 0.4.
+ Section 5, page 11: "xs" is not defined. Probably "as" in intended.
